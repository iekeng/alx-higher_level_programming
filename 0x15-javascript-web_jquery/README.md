easier to work with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript on a website. It provides a wide
range of features and utilities that help developers write more concise and 
efficient code.

HTML structure of a webpage, such as selecting elements, modifying their attributes 
or content, adding or removing elements, and more.

such as changing styles, animations, and transitions.
